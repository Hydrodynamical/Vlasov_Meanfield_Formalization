Coupling-based Wasserstein-1 distance.

This is the first installment of the OT infrastructure that would eventually
close the three remaining `MathlibTODO_*` placeholders in `Vlasov/Basic.lean`
(`_W1ContOn_lscNarrow`, `_W1ContOn_uscNarrow`, `_derivBound`).  All three
gaps reduce to a chain of three missing pieces:

  1. Couplings and the Monge-Kantorovich definition of `W_1`.        ← this file
  2. Existence of optimal couplings (Prokhorov tightness + LSC cost). ← TODO
  3. Full Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality:
       `wasserstein1_dual = wasserstein1_coupling` as equality.       ← TODO

This file provides (1) and the **easy direction** of (3) — the inequality
`wasserstein1_dual μ ν ≤ wasserstein1_coupling μ ν`.  The reverse direction
(the genuine KR theorem) requires Hahn-Banach extension + a duality
argument that is deferred to a follow-up file.

Why the easy direction matters: once it's available, the dobrushin
proof can switch from the dual-formula bound (which requires the hard
direction of KR for upper-bounding W_1 by a coupling cost) to a
coupling-cost bound, modulo just the one remaining duality piece.  This
isolates the trust in a single place rather than spreading it across
the three `lsc`/`usc`/`derivBound` placeholders.

See `formalize/DESIGN.md` for the overall design choices.

/-- A coupling of measures `μ` on `α` and `ν` on `β` is a measure `π` on the
product space whose marginals are exactly `μ` and `ν`.

We use the convention that `Prod.fst` is the `α`-marginal and `Prod.snd` is
the `β`-marginal. -/

/-! ## Coupling-based Wasserstein-1 distance -/

/-- The coupling-based Wasserstein-1 distance: infimum of `∫⁻ edist(x,y) dπ(x,y)`
over all couplings `π` of `(μ, ν)`.  This is the Monge-Kantorovich definition,
to be compared with the dual definition `wasserstein1` (in `Vlasov/Basic.lean`)
via Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality.

We use the Lebesgue lower integral `∫⁻` of `edist` (extended distance, valued
in `ℝ≥0∞`) rather than the Bochner integral `∫` of `dist` (valued in `ℝ`).
This is the standard OT convention: a coupling π whose cost is non-integrable
contributes `⊤` to the infimum (rather than the Bochner junk-value 0), so the
infimum correctly identifies the OT-optimal coupling.  Returns `⊤` if no
coupling exists. -/

/-! ## Kantorovich-Rubinstein: easy direction

The dual-formula `wasserstein1` is at most the coupling-formula
`wasserstein1_coupling`.  This is the *one-line proof* in the OT literature:
for any 1-Lipschitz `φ` and any coupling `π`:

  ∫φ d(μ - ν) = ∫(φ x - φ y) dπ ≤ ∫ |φ x - φ y| dπ ≤ ∫ dist(x,y) dπ.

The reverse inequality is the hard direction of KR (Hahn-Banach extension);
it is deferred to a follow-up file.
-/

/-- KR easy direction.  Under finite-moment assumptions on `μ` and `ν`, the
dual-formula `wasserstein1 μ ν` is bounded above by the coupling-formula
`wasserstein1_coupling μ ν`.

**Proof strategy** (full proof TODO).  By `iSup_le` and `le_iInf`, it suffices
to show that for every 1-Lipschitz `φ` and every coupling `π` of (μ, ν):
`ENNReal.ofReal (∫φ dμ − ∫φ dν) ≤ ∫⁻ edist z.1 z.2 ∂π`.

Two cases:
  - `∫⁻ edist z.1 z.2 ∂π = ⊤`: trivially `_ ≤ ⊤`.  This case is handled.
  - `∫⁻ edist z.1 z.2 ∂π < ⊤`: requires the substantive work:
      (a) `edist`-integrability of `π` implies `dist`-integrability;
      (b) by `Measure.IsCoupling` marginals and `integral_map`,
          `∫φ dμ = ∫(φ ∘ Prod.fst) dπ`, similarly for `ν`;
      (c) `∫φ dμ - ∫φ dν = ∫(φ(z.1) - φ(z.2)) dπ`;
      (d) `|φ(z.1) - φ(z.2)| ≤ dist(z.1, z.2)` by 1-Lipschitz;
      (e) integrability of each side via finite-first-moment of μ and ν,
          derivable from finite coupling cost.
This proof would need ~50-100 lines of measure-theoretic plumbing. -/
