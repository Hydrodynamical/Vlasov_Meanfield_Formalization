## Banked P5 findings for upcoming sessions

### Stage 6 t=0 boundary close — infrastructure shape

**Banked 2026-05-31** (post commit `81c1748`, ahead of the planned Stage 6
session 2 sessions out).

**Sub-sub-sorry**: `CharacteristicFlow.lean` L8572, inside
`vlasovWellPosedness_universal_existence`'s narrow continuity conjunct
(`ContinuousOn (fun t => ∫ z, g z ∂f t) (Set.Ici 0)`), the right-continuity-
at-t=0 case after `rw [← h_eq]`.

**P5 finding: `hasDerivAt_of_hasDerivAt_of_ne_in_nhds` does NOT apply directly**.
Stage 6 t=0 is a `ContinuousWithinAt`-at-endpoint problem (continuity of the
integral function at `t = 0` within `Ici 0`), not a `HasDerivAt`-at-interior
problem.  The helper's signature assumes the point is interior to a
neighborhood where HasDerivAt holds at every nearby ≠ point; t=0 is the LEFT
endpoint of `Ici 0`.

**Applicable close path**: same Mathlib DCT pattern as h_cont_f LEFT/RIGHT
(commits `360813f` + `81c1748`), but applied at the t=0 endpoint:

1. `continuousWithinAt_of_dominated` with constant bound `Cg` (from
   `Bornology.IsBounded (Set.range g)` hypothesis already in scope).
2. AEStronglyMeasurable + bound + integrable_const (standard).
3. Pointwise continuity at t=0 from the right via boundary regularity from
   the per-window `IsLagrangianVlasovSolutionOn` solutions.
4. Bridge `f t = (charX_N t, charV_N t)#(f 0)` for t ∈ Icc 0 N (already
   used in the existing t₀ > 0 branch above the sorry).

**Sub-finding: boundary regularity exposure required**.  Stage 6's
`_universal_existence` body destructures `h_sol_lag N` (L8589) to extract
only basic conjuncts of `IsLagrangianVlasovSolutionOn` (PDE, flow,
pushforward, AEMeasurable).  Boundary regularity from `vlasovWellPosedness_local`'s
output bundle is NOT currently threaded through.

Two options:

* **(a) Enrich** `_universal_existence`'s destructure to extract boundary
  regularity from `vlasovWellPosedness_local`'s output bundle.  Small
  threading change (~30-50 lines) since `vlasovWellPosedness_local` already
  produces the boundary bundle.
* **(b) Inline-derive** boundary continuity from `IsCharacteristicFlowOn`'s
  HasDerivAt-on-Ioo data.  Awkward — `IsCharacteristicFlowOn` provides no
  data at t = 0 directly (Ioo excludes endpoints).

Option (a) is the likely path.

**Estimated total Stage 6 t=0 close**: ~80-100 lines (smaller than h_cont_g
since the DCT pattern is now well-exercised in this arc).

**Cluster retirement contribution**: closes the only remaining sub-sub-sorry
in `vlasovWellPosedness_universal_existence` → Stage 6 declaration retires
(after h_cont_g closes _glue_step).

### h_cont_g path-choice — decision pending

**Banked 2026-05-31** (P5 verification of `MathlibTODO_convolveLipschitzEstimate`
at the planned h_cont_g session's open).

**Sub-sub-sorry**: `CharacteristicFlow.lean` L7559, inside `_glue_step`'s
case (a) close (the last remaining sub-sub-sorry of `_glue_step`'s body
— h_cont_g is the cluster-retirement gate for `_glue_step`).

**P5 finding**: `MathlibTODO_convolveLipschitzEstimate` (Basic.lean L1405)
provides a **W₁-Lipschitz bound on the convolution at a fixed point**:
```
‖convolveFunctionMeasure gradW ρ x - convolveFunctionMeasure gradW σ x‖
    ≤ (L : ℝ) * (wasserstein1 ρ σ).toReal
```
NOT direct continuity-in-time-of-the-measure.  To close h_cont_g via this
placeholder, two additional pieces are needed:

1. **W₁-continuity of `t' ↦ spatialMarginal(f_next t')` at T** — to apply
   the bound's RHS.  Stronger than narrow continuity (which h_cont_f
   proved via DCT on the pushforward equation).  W₁ vs narrow gap requires
   moment-uniformity bridge (Villani-style stability under narrow
   convergence), itself a non-trivial Mathlib gap.
2. **Joint continuity in (μ, x) of `convolveFunctionMeasure`** — for the
   x-side of the integrand argument (`charX_prev t' z`'s variation in t').

**Path options** (decision required before h_cont_g substantive close
attempt):

* **Option A — Direct-DCT via explicit pushforward**.  Express the
  convolution via pushforward: `conv(spatialMarginal(f_next s), x) =
  ∫ z, gradW(x - charX_prev s z) ∂f₀`.  Continuity in s via continuity of
  charX_prev + DCT on f₀.  Bound: `‖gradW(x - charX_prev s z)‖ ≤
  ‖gradW(0)‖ + L * ‖x - charX_prev s z‖` — linear growth in z, NOT
  uniformly bounded.  Requires careful bound via flow-distance-growth-
  bound to dominate.  **Substantive scope**: ~200-300 lines per side
  (LEFT, RIGHT), ~400-600 lines total.  **No new Mathlib placeholder**.

* **Option B — Add `MathlibTODO_convolveContinuousFromNarrowContAndMoment`
  placeholder**.  States the W₁-stability-under-narrow-convergence
  corollary directly: if `t ↦ μ t` is narrowly continuous at t₀ with
  uniform-in-t finite first moment near t₀, and gradW is Lipschitz, then
  `t ↦ convolveFunctionMeasure gradW (μ t) x` is continuous at t₀ for each
  x.  Plus a Joint-continuity version covering the x-side.  **Substantive
  scope**: ~100-200 lines per side using the placeholders.  **+1 (or +2)
  new MathlibTODO declaration(s)** matching project's existing pattern
  (per the four `MathlibTODO_*` placeholders + `MathlibTODO_dobrushin_uniqueness_On`
  + `MathlibTODO_cauchyW1_hasNarrowLimit` existing precedent).

* **Option C — Reformulation avoiding convolution-continuity**.
  Restructure h_cont_g's proof to bypass continuity of the convolution-
  integrand entirely.  E.g., bound the integral DIFFERENCE directly via
  Lipschitz bounds without separating the convolution.  **Substantive
  scope**: unclear — requires invention.  **Risk**: high; possibly stuck
  on the same fundamental gap.

**Trade-offs**:

* **A pros**: no new placeholders; final close is fully substantive in
  the project.  **A cons**: ~400-600 line substantive close session, the
  highest line-count session in the recent arc.  Variance high due to
  flow-distance-growth-bound integration with DCT.
* **B pros**: ~100-200 line close + 1-2 new clearly-deferrable placeholders,
  matches project's MathlibTODO discipline.  Cluster retires `_glue_step`
  declaration (sub-sub-sorry net zero: -1 h_cont_g, +1-2 placeholders, but
  `_glue_step` declaration retires).  **B cons**: adds placeholder(s) to
  the Mathlib-track inventory.
* **C pros**: avoids the W₁ gap entirely.  **C cons**: unknown
  feasibility; not a documented approach.

**Recommendation lean**: Option B.  Matches project's MathlibTODO discipline
(the four abstract placeholders + the two recent additions already
establish the pattern), gives the cleanest cluster retirement (_glue_step
declaration retires, structural debt shifts to a focused leaf placeholder),
and the substantive close composes against well-characterized Mathlib gaps
rather than requiring novel infrastructure.  Decision belongs to user;
documented here for explicit strategic conversation rather than ad-hoc
session execution.

**Decision deadline**: before the h_cont_g session begins.  Per session-
cadence discipline, the strategic conversation needs the option-set
pre-loaded so the session opens as type-(a) execution-mode against a
verified plan rather than type-(b) diagnostic-mode mid-close.

**Decision committed (2026-05-31)**: option B per user authorization.
Placeholder `MathlibTODO_convolveContinuousAtOfNarrowMoment` landed in
commit `a123d63` (Basic.lean L1424+).

**h_cont_g substantive close — scope re-estimate** (post-placeholder
landing, 2026-05-31):

The user's original estimate ("~100-200 lines, bridge-and-compose")
assumed the auxiliary narrow + moment + integrability properties for
`spatialMarginal ∘ f_next` were already in scope or trivially derivable.
They're not — the project's existing infrastructure provides narrow
continuity for the SPECIFIC h_cont_f integrand (compact-support φ), not
the general bounded continuous test functions the placeholder requires
for its narrow-continuity hypothesis.  Plus moment continuity isn't in
scope at all.

**Realistic scope re-estimate**:

* **Sub-helper 1**: narrow continuity of `t ↦ spatialMarginal(f_next t)`
  at T for general bounded continuous test functions.  ~50-80 lines
  (h_cont_f's pattern generalized from compact-support to bounded-range).
* **Sub-helper 2**: moment continuity of `t ↦ ∫ ‖y‖ ∂(spatialMarginal(f_next t))`
  at T.  ~50-80 lines (DCT with flow-distance-growth-bound dominator).
* **Sub-helper 3**: convolution integrability uniformity across t.
  ~30-50 lines (Lipschitz + moment finiteness).
* **h_cont_g main close** composing sub-helpers 1-3 + placeholder + outer
  DCT.  ~100-200 lines per side (LEFT + RIGHT) + union.

**Total realistic**: ~330-540 lines.  Above the user's ~100-200 estimate
by a factor of ~2-3x.  Substantively achievable but requires multi-
commit structuring per P4 API-lock pattern.

**Recommended decomposition** (per P4 discipline for dense composition):

* Commit 1 (this commit's predecessor `a123d63`): placeholder landed.
* Commit 2: sub-helper 1 (narrow continuity for general bounded
  continuous integrands).  ~80 lines.  Single focused close.
* Commit 3: sub-helper 2 (moment continuity).  ~80 lines.  Single focused
  close.
* Commit 4: h_cont_g LEFT substantive close composing sub-helpers + placeholder.
  ~150 lines.  Single focused close.
* Commit 5: h_cont_g RIGHT substantive close mirroring LEFT.  ~150 lines.
* Commit 6: union for h_cont_g → `_glue_step` cluster retirement.
  ~20 lines.

**Session-budget allocation**: 2-3 focused sessions per the per-commit
estimate.  Phase A endpoint shifts from "3-4 focused sessions" to
"4-5 focused sessions" with this revised scope.

**Per session-cadence**: each commit above is a type-(a) execution
session with pre-loaded brief from the preceding commit's residual
structure.  No diagnostic pivots expected since the path is now
characterized end-to-end.

## Phase B sequencing — deliberate decision pending

**Banked 2026-05-31**, decision required before Phase A endpoint arrives
(estimated 3-4 focused sessions out, after h_cont_g + Stage 6 t=0 close +
any residual L≥1 / `MathlibTODO_dobrushin_uniqueness_On` items).

**Question**: post-Phase-A, which of these comes first?

* **Cleanup document phase**: write the project's final research artifact
  documentation — codebase outline regeneration, Mathlib PR drafts for the
  closeable `MathlibTODO_*` placeholders (probably 2-3 of the 4-5
  remaining), the M-series statement-correction narrative (the marquee
  forward-only refactor), the four-series discipline framework summary
  as a process retrospective.
* **W̄ refactor phase**: discharge the `L ≥ 1` regime sub-sub-sorry by
  replacing the per-ball-flow's `(T + 1)²` additive offset with a `T²`-
  shape via Dobrushin's truncated metric W̄.  Removes the `0 < L < 1`
  restriction from `vlasovWellPosedness`'s scope.  Substantively closes
  the marquee for all Lipschitz regimes.

**Decision affects**:

* **Mathlib PR drafting order**: the cleanup phase's PR drafts compose
  against the project's current Mathlib placeholder set.  If W̄ refactor
  reduces placeholder count (e.g., by retiring `MathlibTODO_convolveLipschitzEstimate`
  if its role changes under W̄), the PR drafts shift.
* **Cleanup document's marquee framing**: cleanup-first means the document
  reads "0 < L < 1 regime, with L ≥ 1 as deliberate W̄-refactor-pending
  out-of-scope item."  W̄-first means the document reads "full Lipschitz
  range, complete formalization."
* **Session-cadence over Phase B**: cleanup phase is documentation-heavy
  (lower per-session line count, higher information density), W̄ refactor
  is execution-heavy (~200-400 line sessions per the per-ball-flow surgery
  estimate).  The session-cadence watch-list pattern (P6 + alternation)
  suggests interleaving them rather than running purely sequentially —
  but the *starting* phase matters for project narrative coherence.

**Trade-off shape**:

* **Cleanup-first pros**: ships a complete documentation artifact at the
  earliest moment; cleanup phase is well-suited to current operating mode
  (mostly text + reformulation); allows W̄ refactor to be planned with
  cleanup-phase insight on what's actually used downstream.
* **Cleanup-first cons**: documents an incomplete-Lipschitz-range result;
  W̄ refactor's downstream effects on documentation require a second
  cleanup pass.
* **W̄-first pros**: ships a Lipschitz-complete result; cleanup phase
  documents the final state cleanly without revision.
* **W̄-first cons**: defers documentation by 2-4 sessions; W̄ refactor's
  exact scope is currently uncertain (Mathlib infrastructure for
  W̄ + Dobrushin's truncated estimates is not well-trodden in current
  Mathlib).

**Decision deadline**: the session AFTER h_cont_g lands (i.e., before the
Stage 6 t=0 session), per the user's framing.  At that point Phase A
endpoint is 1-2 sessions away and the post-Phase-A sequencing becomes
load-bearing for the next strategic conversation.

**Decision currently held as**: pending.  No commitment.  Both paths remain
viable.  The strategic conversation should revisit explicitly at the
recommended deadline rather than letting Phase A endpoint arrive with the
sequencing un-decided (which would force an ad-hoc choice).
